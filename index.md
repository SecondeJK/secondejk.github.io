============

As the organiser for brumPHP, I'm on a mission to create a bigger ecosystem for Birmingham, and a PHP community for the city as part of the wider Midlands tech scene.

I don't have much time for personal snazzy pages, but my current stack does involve things like:
* PHP7
* Docker
* Symfony
* Node.js
* MariaDB
* Varnish
